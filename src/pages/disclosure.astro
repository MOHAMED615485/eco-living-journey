	<p>I believe in being 100% honest with you. To keep <strong>Eco Living Journey</strong> running as a free resource, I participate in affiliate marketing programs.</p>

	<h2>How It Works</h2>
	<p>When you click on certain links on this site and make a purchase, I may receive a small commission from the retailer at <strong>no extra cost to you</strong>.</p>

	<h2>Affiliate Partnerships</h2>
	<p>
		I am a participant in several affiliate advertising programs, including the Amazon Associates Program. 
		This means I earn commissions on qualifying purchases made through links on this site to various 
		retailers and service providers. As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.
	</p>

	<h2>My Promise</h2>
	<p>
		I only recommend products and services that I truly believe add value to your life. 
		Whether it's a small eco-swap like wool dryer balls or a larger investment in home technology, 
		my goal is to provide honest, helpful information. Your trust is the most stable asset I have.
