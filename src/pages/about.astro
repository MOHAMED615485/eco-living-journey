	<h2>Hi, I'm Ethan. I thought going green was only for rich people.</h2>
	
	<p>
		If you look at Instagram or big magazines, sustainable living looks like a luxury aesthetic. It's all $100 organic cotton shirts, high-end solar panels, and perfectly matching glass pantry jars.
	</p>

	<p>
		I started <strong>Eco Living Journey</strong> because I realized the industry was lying to us. True sustainability isn't about buying new, expensive eco-products. It is about using less. And when you use less, you spend less.
	</p>

	<p>
		I'm not a perfect zero-waste guru. I'm just a normal person figuring out how to reduce my footprint while sticking to a strict budget. I make mistakes, I occasionally buy things in plastic, and I am learning as I go.

	<h3>What you will actually find here:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Honest Reviews:</strong> If an eco-swap is too expensive or doesn't work, I'll tell you.</li>
		<li><strong>DIYs that don't suck:</strong> Simple, cheap recipes for cleaning and living that actually do the job.</li>
		<li><strong>No Guilt:</strong> We celebrate small wins here. Every little bit counts.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		You don't need a massive budget to make a difference. Stick around, and let's figure this out together.
