\## Sustainability Doesn't Have to Be Expensive



A common myth about eco-friendly living is that it costs a fortune. We see expensive organic cotton shirts and high-tech solar gadgets and think, \*"I can't afford that."\*



But the truth? \*\*Real sustainability is about using less.\*\* And using less means spending less.



If you are just starting your eco-living journey, you don't need to buy new things. In fact, the best way to start is by swapping out wasteful habits for reusable ones. Here are 5 simple swaps that will save you hundreds of dollars this year.



\### 1. Ditch the Plastic Water Bottles

\* \*\*The Cost:\*\* Buying a $2 bottle of water every day costs you over \*\*$700 a year\**.

\* \*\*The Swap:\** Invest $20 in a high-quality stainless steel bottle. It lasts for years, keeps your water cold, and eliminates thousands of plastic bottles from the ocean.



\### 2. Switch to LED Light Bulbs

\* \*\*The Cost:\** Traditional incandescent bulbs waste 90% of their energy as heat.

\* \*\*The Swap:\*\* LED bulbs use 75% less energy and last 25 times longer. Replacing just the five most-used bulbs in your house can save you around \*\*$75 a year\** on electricity bills.



\### 3. Wash Laundry in Cold Water

\* \*\*The Cost:\** Heating water accounts for about 90% of the energy used to run a washing machine.

\* \*\*The Swap:\** Switch your dial to "Cold." Modern detergents are designed to work perfectly in cold water. You’ll save energy, money, and your clothes will actually last longer without the heat damage.



\### 4. Bring Your Own Shopping Bags

\* \*\*The Cost:\** Many stores in the US and UK now charge for plastic bags. Over a year of grocery trips, this adds up.

\* \*\*The Swap:\** Keep a few sturdy canvas bags in your car or by your front door. They are stronger, hold more groceries, and help you avoid those annoying extra fees.



\### 5. Make Your Own Cleaning Spray

\* \*\*The Cost:\** A bottle of "all-purpose" cleaner can cost $5 and is often filled with harsh chemicals.

\* \*\*The Swap:\*\* Mix equal parts \*\*white vinegar and water\** in a reusable spray bottle. It costs pennies to make, cuts through grease effectively, and is completely non-toxic for your family and pets.



\### Start Small, Save Big

You don't have to do all of these at once. Pick \*\*one\*\* swap this week. Once it becomes a habit, move to the next.
