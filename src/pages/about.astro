	<h2>Welcome to Eco Living Journey!</h2>
	
	<p>
		I started this project because I realized that living sustainably isn't just about saving the planet—it's about building a better, more intentional life. For a long time, I thought "going green" meant buying expensive gadgets, but I've learned that the most powerful changes are the simple ones.
	</p>

	<p>
		My mission is to show you that sustainability can actually <strong>save you money</strong> and simplify your day-to-day routine. Whether you are in Algeria or a Tier 1 country, these principles work for everyone.
	</p>

	<p>
		From ditching plastic bottles to making your own eco-friendly cleaning supplies, I’m here to share the exact steps I've taken on my own journey. Let’s make the world a little cleaner and our lives a little better, one swap at a time!
