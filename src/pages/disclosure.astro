	<p>I believe in being 100% honest with you. To keep <strong>Eco Living Journey</strong> running as a free resource, I participate in affiliate marketing programs.</p>

	<h2>How It Works</h2>
	<p>When you click on certain links on this site and make a purchase, I may receive a small commission from the retailer at <strong>no extra cost to you</strong>.</p>

	<h2>Amazon Associates Disclosure</h2>
	<p>As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases. This is a standard requirement for all Amazon partners.</p>

	<h2>My Promise</h2>
	<p>I only recommend products (like wool dryer balls or high-efficiency tech) that I truly believe add value to your life. Your trust is the most stable asset I have.</p>
