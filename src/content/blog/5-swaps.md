## Sustainability Doesn't Have to Be Expensive

A common myth about eco-friendly living is that it costs a fortune. We see expensive organic cotton shirts and high-tech solar gadgets and think, "I can't afford that."

But the truth? **Real sustainability is about using less.** And using less means spending less.

If you are just starting your eco-living journey, you don't need to buy new things. In fact, the best way to start is by swapping out wasteful habits for reusable ones. Here are 5 simple swaps that will save you hundreds of dollars this year.

### 1. Ditch the Plastic Water Bottles

* **The Cost:** Buying a $2 bottle of water every day costs you over **$700 a year**.
* **The Swap:** Invest $20 in a high-quality stainless steel bottle. It lasts for years and eliminates thousands of plastic bottles.

### 2. Switch to LED Light Bulbs

* **The Cost:** Traditional bulbs waste 90% of their energy as heat.
* **The Swap:** LED bulbs use 75% less energy. Replacing your five most-used bulbs can save you around **$75 a year**.

### 3. Wash Laundry in Cold Water

* **The Cost:** Heating water accounts for 90% of the energy used by a washing machine.
* **The Swap:** Switch your dial to cold. Modern detergents work just as well in cold water, and you'll save around **$60 a year** on your energy bill.

### 4. Use Reusable Grocery Bags

* **The Cost:** Many places now charge 10 to 15 cents per plastic bag, which adds up!
* **The Swap:** Keep a few sturdy canvas bags in your car or by the door. They hold more groceries and don't rip!

### 5. Make Your Own Cleaning Spray

* **The Cost:** Name-brand chemical cleaners cost $4 to $8 a bottle.
* **The Swap:** Mix white vinegar, water, and a few drops of lemon essential oil. It costs pennies, cleans beautifully, and removes toxic chemicals from your home.
